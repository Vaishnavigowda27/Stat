1. Preprocessing Filters
Filters → Unsupervised → Attributes

RemoveType (parameter)

Nominal → Apply
Numeric → Apply


2. Attribute Selection & Training
Step 1: Train decision tree
Step 2: Select attributes

Use Attribute Evaluator → InfoGainAttributeEval

Rank attributes using IG score

Search Method: Ranker

Remove attributes with low IG score (i.e., IG = 0)

Train decision tree again


3. Preprocessing & Classification
Preprocess tab:

Upload file → Filter → Normalize → Classify
Classifier: J48


4. Model Training
Use either Naive Bayes or Decision Tree

Try Percentage Split:

60:40

70:30

80:20

Compare accuracy and interpret results


5. Cross Validation
Train using:

Naive Bayes or Decision Tree

Perform Cross Validation:
5-fold
10-fold
Compare results


6. Model Comparison
Classify → Bayes → NaiveBayes

Try removing/combining features

Compare different models


7. Same as Step 6 for Decision Trees


8. Theory Part
Study theoretical concepts


9. Pruning Experiment
First: Train decision tree without pruning

Then:

Classify → J48

Reduced Error Pruning → True (parameter)

N = 5 → Not needed

Compare cross-validation results (5-fold vs 10-fold)


10. Iris Dataset Workflow
Step 1:

Classify → Trees → J48

Write the decision tree

Classify → Rules:

PART → Write the rules

OneR → Write the rules


11. Clustering
Cluster → Simple k-means

Parameter: Classes to clusters evaluation

Set k values


12. SVM Classification
Classify → SMO

Use cross-validation
